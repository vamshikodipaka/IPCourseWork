Hi, this is the README file for the project "Performance Evaluation of Various Image Denoising Algorithms"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the code:
================
1. Unzip the project.zip 

2. Change the present working directory of MATLAB to project folder, where the code is avaialble.

3. The 'Waveletmain.m' contains everything for decomposition, reconstruction and denoising. 
	Run this file to see the Wavelets based Denoising results

4. GSCD_2D.m contain Tikonov's based denoising. Run this to see the results.

5. Run my_wiener.m to see the results for wiener based image denoising.

6. All the functions developed for the task are well commented.
	type 'help <functionName>' to get to know how to use the functions.

7. Code is given in Appendix file.
